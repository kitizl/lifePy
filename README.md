# lifePy
An implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Python (with matplotlib)

## Usage

To run this code, you will need `matplotlib` and `numpy`.

The initial state is currently set to **GLIDER**. You can change the modes by changing the name of the parameter in `setConditions()`.

Similarly, you can also change the size of the space, if you like.

The boundaries are not periodic, and therefore the _objects_ would die upon touching the border.

Also, this is like version -1. This shouldn't be up yet. But I want to put it up. Sue me.
